# Vladimir Belsch

Founder / Systems Architect · Decision Systems · Applied ML

My work centers on designing and operating decision systems under real-world constraints.  
It spans system architecture, data modeling, and applied machine learning, particularly in domains where uncertainty, rules, and human judgment interact.  
Common patterns include graph-based domain models, conditional decision logic, and feedback-driven systems that must remain interpretable in production.  
The emphasis is on building systems that can be understood, adapted, and maintained as requirements evolve.

## Scope of Work

### Systems Architecture & Ownership
Design and operation of end-to-end systems, from initial architecture through production, iteration, and external scrutiny.  
Comfortable making and revisiting architectural tradeoffs around service boundaries, asynchrony, and operational complexity.  
Work typically spans frontend, backend, data, and infrastructure rather than isolated components.

### Backend & Data Systems
Design and implementation of API-driven backends and internal services, with an emphasis on correctness, auditability, and long-lived data models.  
Experience working with messy, real-world business data: ingestion, normalization, feature derivation, and stateful workflows.  
Particular attention to failure modes, retries, idempotency, and systems that must keep working when assumptions break.

### Decision & Graph-Based Systems
Design of graph-based domain models to represent constraints, relationships, and conditional logic that do not fit cleanly into tabular abstractions.  
Translation of business rules and policies into ontology-driven systems combining rules, graph logic, and probabilistic signals.  
Comfort working with latent concepts such as appetite, risk posture, and acceptance likelihood.

### Applied Machine Learning (Pragmatic)
Use of machine learning as a component within larger systems, rather than as an end in itself.  
Emphasis on feature engineering from operational data, evaluation in business terms, and integration into real workflows.  
Experience incorporating model explainability directly into user-facing and operational decision paths.

### Infrastructure & Integrations
Deployment and maintenance of production services, with attention to security boundaries, secrets management, and operational hygiene.  
Hands-on integration with external systems via APIs and webhooks, including authentication flows, rate limits, and failure handling.  
Comfort debugging production issues calmly and methodically.

### Leadership & Execution
Acting as technical lead and architectural owner, including mentoring, unblocking others, and repairing underperforming systems.  
Translating ambiguous problems into concrete technical plans and executable work.  
Comfortable making irreversible decisions with incomplete information and living with the consequences.

## Current Threads

- Graph-based representations for conditional decision logic  
- Feedback loops between human overrides and model behavior  
- When structural models outperform feature-heavy approaches  
- Designing systems that remain explainable under operational pressure
