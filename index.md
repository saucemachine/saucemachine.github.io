# Vladimir Belsch

Founder / Systems Architect · Decision Systems · Applied ML

My work centers on designing and operating decision systems under real-world constraints.  
It spans system architecture, data modeling, and applied machine learning, particularly in domains where uncertainty, rules, and human judgment interact.  
Common patterns include graph-based domain models, conditional decision logic, and feedback-driven systems that must remain interpretable in production.  
The emphasis is on building systems that can be understood, adapted, and maintained as requirements evolve.
