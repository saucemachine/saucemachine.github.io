    <p>
      My work centers on designing and operating decision systems under real-world constraints.
      It spans system architecture, data modeling, and applied machine learning, particularly in
      domains where uncertainty, rules, and human judgment interact.
    </p>

    <p>
      Common patterns include graph-based domain models, conditional decision logic, and systems
      that incorporate the outcomes of prior decisions while remaining interpretable in production.
      The emphasis is on building systems that can be understood, adapted, and maintained as
      requirements evolve.
